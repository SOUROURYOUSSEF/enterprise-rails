<p>When we talk about selecting technology stack for building enterprise applications, Ruby/Rails does not come to mind. Most common answer is Java.
And there is a good reason for it. Most established enterprises have gone through a painful transition from proprietary technologies from IBM,
Digital and others to Java and related open-source stacks (LAMP, Apache, etc.).</p>

<p>New enterprise software by giants such as Google, Twitter, GroupOn are not built on Java. They use newer languages like Python, Ruby, JavaScript
, Scala and open source frameworks such as DJango, PHPCake and Ruby-On-Rails, Akka, etc.</p>

<p>Over the past few years, Ruby-On-Rails has gain significant traction among young start-ups and traditional corporate IT departments
to a smaller extent.</p>

<p>I recently worked on a client project that involved creating an architecture/infrastructure for developing an enterprise
application on Rails framework. Refer to the WIKI page for a detailed discussion on the architecture.  Many mistakes were made and
many lessons were learned while working on this project.</p>

<p>This open-source project aims to extract those learnings and past experiences into creating a reusable blueprint for
developing enterprise applications on Rails platform.</p>

<ul>
<li>Modular plug-in architecture</li>
<li>Clear separation of concerns</li>
<li>Use of Rails best practices and idioms</li>
<li>Fully integrated ready-to-use sample application</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<a id="what-is-enterprise-application" class="anchor" href="#what-is-enterprise-application" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What is Enterprise Application?</h3>

<p>Several characteristics distinguishes Enterprise Application from desktop and SaaS applications. Enterprise applications are
complex, scalable, distributed, component-based, and mission-critical. These applications are critical to businesses for
running day-to-day operations. Think of stock-trading application, airline reservation application.</p>

<p>These applications share common architecture concerns such as following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Security</li>
<li>Privacy</li>
<li>Data Governance</li>
<li>High Availability</li>
<li>Performance</li>
<li>Interoperability</li>
<li>Integration</li>
<li>Compliance</li>
<li>Provisioning and licensing</li>
</ul>
