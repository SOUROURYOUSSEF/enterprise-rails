{"name":"sass-rails","tagline":"Blueprint of a Saas Rails Application","body":"# Blueprint of an Enterprise Rails Application\r\n\r\nWhen we talk about selecting technology stack for building enterprise applications, Ruby/Rails does not come to mind. Most common answer is Java.\r\nAnd there is a good reason for it. Most established enterprises have gone through a painful transition from proprietary technologies from IBM,\r\nDigital and others to Java and related open-source stacks (LAMP, Apache, etc.).\r\n\r\nNew enterprise software by giants such as Google, Twitter, GroupOn are not built on Java. They use newer languages like Python, Ruby, JavaScript\r\n, Scala and open source frameworks such as DJango, PHPCake and Ruby-On-Rails, Akka, etc.\r\n\r\nOver the past few years, Ruby-On-Rails has gain significant traction among young start-ups and traditional corporate IT departments\r\nto a smaller extent.\r\n\r\n### Can Ruby/Rails be used for building large scale enterprise applications?\r\n\r\nI recently worked on a client project that involved creating an architecture/infrastructure for developing an enterprise\r\napplication on Rails framework. Refer to the WIKI page for a detailed discussion on the architecture.  Many mistakes were made and\r\nmany lessons were learned while working on this project.\r\n\r\nThis open-source project aims to extract those learnings and past experiences into creating a reusable blueprint for\r\ndeveloping enterprise applications on Rails platform.\r\n\r\n- Modular plug-in architecture\r\n- Clear separation of concerns\r\n- Use of Rails best practices and idioms\r\n- Fully integrated ready-to-use sample application\r\n\r\n\r\n### What is Enterprise Application?\r\n\r\nSeveral characteristics distinguishes Enterprise Application from desktop and SaaS applications. Enterprise applications are\r\ncomplex, scalable, distributed, component-based, and mission-critical. These applications are critical to businesses for\r\nrunning day-to-day operations. Think of stock-trading application, airline reservation application.\r\n\r\nThese applications share common architecture concerns such as following:\r\n\r\n- Security\r\n- Privacy\r\n- Data Governance\r\n- High Availability\r\n- Performance\r\n- Interoperability\r\n- Integration\r\n- Compliance\r\n- Provisioning and licensing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
