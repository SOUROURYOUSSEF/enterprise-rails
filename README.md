# Blueprint for an Enterprise Rails Application

When we talk about selecting technology stack for building enterprise applications, Ruby/Rails does not come to mind. The most common answer is Java.
And there is a good reason for it. Most estabhished enterprises have gone through a painful transition from proprietary technologies from IBM,
Digital and others to Java and related open-source stacks (LAMP, Apache, etc.) Java turned 20 this year.

The new enterprise software by giants such as Google, Twitter, GroupOn are not built on Java. They use newer languages like Python, Ruby, JavaScript
and open source frameworks such as DJango, PHPCake and Ruby-On-Rails.

Over the past few years, Ruby-On-Rails has gain significant traction among young start-ups and traditional corporate IT departments
to a smaller extent.

## Can Ruby/Rails be used for building large scale enterprise applications?
